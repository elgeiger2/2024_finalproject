    2. Scenario
        User is greeted with the a choropleth layer on a map of Gaza indicating levels of
        structural damge to the areas. Additional layers will be marked with checked boxes
        easily visible to the user. Option to open layer in new panel will aslo be given
        to allow for comparability and inform insight.
