### Final Proposal
1. Target User Profile
    1. Name & Position: Natalya Schroeder, UNU-CPR Think Tank Worker
        Natalya works fro the United Nations University Centre for Policy Research. The topic on everyone's mind in the UN sphere is how to put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Natalya's think tank in particular is one of many responsible for discussing solutions. During these discussion however, Natalya has noticed many in her group, inlcuding herself, have had issues visualizing and comparing their different ideas. Natalya would like to gain insight in her next presentation to the group using historical trends in migration patterns and casualty estimates to make several predictions considering their soultion scenarios. From there, her group can rank feasability, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of each proposed plan to take to those with decision making power with the goal of creating a permanent and peaceful solution.

        Natalya's father, Dr. Schroeder, had previously worked under the Clinton administration as an advisor to plan and execute the Oslo accords in 1993. Being of Jewish heritage themselves, Dr. Schroeder had always been invested in the conlict surrounding Israel and Palestine, and wished to see both sides reach everlasting peace. However, the Oslo accords ended in failure and fighting continued. Natalya would grow up with stories of how her father wished they could have done things differently, including better visualization of outcomes and increased focused on trends in the sentiment of the populations involved. Natalya wants to carry on her father's work and put a permanenet end to this conflict.
        
2. Use Case Scenario
    1. Scenario #1
        Upon opening the website, the user is prompted through a series of interactive maps with specific layers enabled to tell the story of the conflict leading to the present. The first interactive will be of 1917 when the land changes hands from the Ottomans to the British. A graduated symbol layer will be turned on to show the demographics at this point in time. Text giving context will also be available on a click of different areas on the map. The next map, reached with an arrow click or key press, will be 1947 in the British partition of the area. Borders for that partition will be shown along with current demographics upon a click. A small animation will aslo be played on the click of next. Over the next few maps, the user will be made to focus on the changing borders between recognized Israel and Palestine over the many wars and agreements and will be able to notice the movements of populations during this time. Leading to today, the user will then be interetsed to see graphics on the current sentiment towards peace based on news and survey data. They will aslo be able to dig a little deeper on current leadership on both sides and their policies. After the stroy board session is completed, the user will reach the end interactive where all maps and layers are made available to them. (More on final interactive in scenario 2) 
    2. Scenario #2
        The user has previously used the application wishes to use the final interactive to create image products for a presentation. Before the story mode begins, the user is presented with an option to skip to the final map. Attention is then directed to the side bar at the left side of the screen, where the options to change map and toggle layers are located. Possible layers to choose from will include gdp if avaliable, military strength, casualties where applicable, population, and political group in power. There will be an option at the top left of the screen to download the current map and map layers as a pdf for use in presentation.
